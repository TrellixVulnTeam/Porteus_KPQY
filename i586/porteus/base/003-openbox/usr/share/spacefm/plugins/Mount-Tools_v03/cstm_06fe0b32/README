DESCRIPTION
  Edit configuration file for mnttools.  Configuration file contains the following variables: mntroot, save_history, history_file, general_mntopts, sshfs_mntopts, ftpfs_mntopts, cifs_mntopts, and winfs_mntopts.  Defaults for these variables are:

  - mntroot=/media #directory for mounting media.  You must have read/write/execute to this directory (i.e. "sudo chmod 777 /media")
  - save_history=true #whether or not to save mount parameters for Samba, SSH, and FTP mounts
  - history_file=$HOME/.mnttools_history #location of history file
  - general_mntopts=noatime #mount options for all mount types
  - winfs_mntopts=gid=100,umask=002 #mount options for vfat and ntfs filesystems
  - sshfs_mntopts=reconnect,compression=yes,workaround=rename,gid=100,umask=002 #mount options for ssh share
  - ftpfs_mntopts=gid=100,umask=002 #mount options for ftp share
  - cifs_mntopts=gid=100 #mount options for Samba share

  If you made changes to configuration file, especially mntroot and winfs_mntopts variables, make sure to also edit udev rule (/etc/udev/rules.d/80-mnttools.rules) to use configuation file.
