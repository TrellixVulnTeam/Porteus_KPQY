## Fake Make script for Porteus Linux
# This script is installed in 001-core.xzm and will display 
# a warning letting the user know that the real "make" utility
# is not installed on their system.  Once the user downloads
# and installs the development module, this script will be
# overwritten by the real "make" and everything will work as
# it should.
