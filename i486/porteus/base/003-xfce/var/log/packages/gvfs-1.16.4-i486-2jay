PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
gvfs: gvfs (glib virtual filesystems)
gvfs:
gvfs: gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the I/O
gvfs: abstractions of libgio (a library included in the glib2 package).
gvfs: It installs several modules that are automatically used by applications
gvfs: that use the libgio API.  There is also fuse support that allows
gvfs: applications not using gio to access the gvfs filesystems.
