PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
poppler: poppler (a library for rendering PDF documents)
poppler:
poppler: Poppler is a library based on the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek
poppler: Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC.  Since xpdf does not provide a shared
poppler: library, whenever a flaw was found potentially dozens of applications
poppler: incorporating code from xpdf would have to be patched.  By providing
poppler: a centralized PDF library this duplicated effort will be eliminated.
