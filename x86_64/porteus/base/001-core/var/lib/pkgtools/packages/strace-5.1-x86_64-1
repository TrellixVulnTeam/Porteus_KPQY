PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
strace: strace (trace system calls and signals)
strace:
strace: Strace allows you to trace the execution of a command. It runs the
strace: specified command until it exits, intercepting signals and system
strace: calls and dumping the information to the standard error. System
strace: administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it
strace: invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the source
strace: is not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in
strace: order to trace them.
