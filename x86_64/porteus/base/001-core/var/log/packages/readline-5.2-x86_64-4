readline: The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by
readline: applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
readline: in.  Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available.  The Readline
readline: library includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously
readline: entered command lines, to recall and perhaps edit those lines, and
readline: perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
