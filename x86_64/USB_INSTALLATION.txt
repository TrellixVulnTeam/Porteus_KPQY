Porteus can be installed to a flash drive or hard 
drive in several ways.

FOR EFI SYSTEMS:
Ensure the first partition is of type FAT32.
a) Copy the EFI, boot and porteus folders onto the FAT32 partition.
You may create a second partition with a linux filesystem for the porteus folder.
If you do so, you need to add the from=/mnt/sdb2 cheatcode to the porteus-v4.0-x86_64.cfg file.
This file is located in the porteus folder.

FOR BIOS SYSTEMS:
From Windows:
a) copy the contents of the ISO image to your drive
b) navigate to the \boot folder and launch the 
'Porteus-installer-for-Windows.exe' script
c) verify you are installing to the correct drive and press 'Enter' to 
complete the installation

From any Linux Distribution other than Porteus:
a) copy the contents of the ISO image to your drive
b) navigate to the /boot folder and launch the installer
'bash Porteus-installer-for-Linux.com'
c) verify you are installing to the correct drive and press 'Enter' to
complete the installation

From Porteus itself (booted from CD):
a) launch 'Porteus Installer' from the desktop menu,
 under the 'System' heading (if you are
prompted for the root password, it is toor)
b) plug in your usb drive or select a partition
on a hard drive
c) follow the on-screen instructions
